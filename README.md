# SoC-competitive-coding

week-1:
     <ul>
     <li> The Introductory Week was about C++ STL - stacks queues,priority queues,etc </li>
     <li>I had solved problems in introductory set of problems in CSES </li>
     </ul>
 week-2:
     <ul>     
     <li>The second week was about sorting and searching algorithms,etc</li>
     <li>I solved problems in sorting and searching set of problems in  CSES</li>
     </ul>
week-3:
     <ul>
     <li>The third week was about graphs and tracing algorithms like BFS and DFS</li>
     <li> Solved Problems on graph algorithms in CSES and Codeforces</li>
     </ul>
week-4:
     <ul>
     <li>This week was entirely about different type of algorithms that is divide and conquer that can be used for various other cases </li>
     <li>I solved few problems in codeforces</li>
     </ul>
week-5:
    <ul>
    <li> The Week 5 was about dynamic programming, mainly about memoisation and tabulation</li>
     <li>I solved problems on dynamic programming in CSES problem set. </li>
    </ul>
week-6:
    <ul>
    <li> This Week-6 was entirely about greedy algorithms that can be used to optimise the time complexity and to get the optimal solution </li>
     <li>I had solved questions based on greedy algorithms in Codeforces</li>
    </ul>
