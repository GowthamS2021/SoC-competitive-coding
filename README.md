week-4:
     <ul>
     <li>this week was entirely about different type of algorithms that is divide and conquer that can be used for various other cases </li>
     <li>I solved few problems in codeforces</li>
     </ul>
week-5:
    <ul>
    <li> the Week 5 was about dynamic programming, mainly about memoisation and tabulation</li>
     <li>I solved problems on dynamic programming in CSES problem set. </li>
    </ul>
week-6:
    <ul>
    <li> This Week-6 was entirely about greedy algorithms that can be used to optimise the time complexity and to get the optimal solution </li>
     <li>I had solved questions based on greedy algorithms in Codeforces</li>
    </ul>
